# associator
this DATA mining program is designed for extracting association rules using a hash tree, given the minimal confidence, and maximal number of rules, it only works with the database embedded in it.

The decision tree is called ECLAT, something i figured out before looking it up to see it existed before, well,just another hivemind ...

The first tool is meant to filter/format data in database over an XML file, to be located in "C:\", with a readable extension and header for the second program to recognise.

The second tool just extract rules using a decision tree.

# Important

To note that the database "base.db" must be placed in "C:\", and the program should run as administrator.

This program is free to use and modify, under the context of this license.
